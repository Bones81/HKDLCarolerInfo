    <h1>HKDL Caroler Info 2020</h1>
    
    <h2>First Things First</h2>
    <p>Welcome, carolers! I thought a reference website could be helpful as newbies and vets alike try to learn/remember what this contract requires of us.</p>
    <p>First off, congratulations on earning this contract. Almost everyone who has done it considers it a highlight of their career and life. Hong Kong is an amazing city, and the people are equally amazing. There are too many good things about this contract to cover in this short intro!</p>
    <p>The impetus for creating this site was the desire to have an easy resource for lots of info about the contract, as shared by those who have done the contract before. You'll have <b>A HUGE AMOUNT</b> of information thrown at you, and the hope is that having a page with that info at least somewhat organized will be helpful as we all try to process it.</p>

    <h2>Documents: a cheat sheet</h2>
    
    <p>In the work visa application and contract completion process, you will be asked to submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies, and some in both forms.</p>
    <p>Here is a cheat sheet to get you started collecting the appropriate paperwork, even before you receive the official emails from HK Disney's HR peeps requesting all these items. Especially for newbies, it may take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to collect these materials now so that you have them somewhat ready when it's time to mail them or email them.</p>
    
    <h4>You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL's HR department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work visas from the Immigration Dept. When you FedEx anything to HK, make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can reimburse you.</h4>
    
    <h3>Items you'll likely need in <strong>digital form</strong>:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><span>Copy of your passport info and signature page(s)</span></li>
        <li>(Returning carolers only) <span>Copy of your previous Hong Kong visa(s) and landing slip(s).</span></li>
        <li><span>Copy of your updated CV/resume</span></li>
        <li><span>Copy of your driver's license</span> (if you have one)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Items you'll likely need <strong>hard copies</strong> of:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><span>Passport-style photos</span></li>
        <li><span>Copy of your university degree/diploma(s) or academic transcript(s).</span> <em>(This was one of the ones that took me a hot minute to find.)</em></li>
        <li>If you have obtained a degree or higher qualifications in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong, please provide evidence and copies of your Hong Kong student visa. <em>(Probably doesn't apply to any of us.)</em></li>
        <li><span>Copy of your relevant training or professional certificate(s)</span> (if any).</li>
        <li><span>Signed reference letters,</span> or copies of your signed employment contracts, staff identity cards, brochures, newspaper articles or pamphlets, etc. with your name or photos evidencing your relevant experience.</li>
        <li><span>Copies of a few of your performance photos with identifying info</span> (3 to 4 is sufficient).</li>
        <li><span>The visa application form ID990A (original required)</span> <em>(They will provide a link to this file, arguably the most important document of the bunch.)</em></li>
        <li><span>Copy of your HKITP employment contract.</span> <em>(You may have to wait to receive your contract via FedEx. If time is of the essence, they will probably ask you to email them copies of all the contract pages to expedite the visa process and then bring the hard copies with you to HK to turn in during your HR orientation.)</em></li>
    </ol>
