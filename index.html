        <h2 id="first">First Things First</h2>
            <p>Welcome, carolers! I thought a reference website could be helpful as newbies and vets alike try to learn/remember what this contract requires of us.</p>
            <p>First off, congratulations on earning this contract. Almost everyone who has done it considers it a highlight of their career and life. Hong Kong is an amazing city, and the people are equally amazing. There are too many good things about this contract to cover in one place!</p>
            <p>The point of this site is to have an easy resource for lots of info about the contract, as shared by those who have done the contract before. You'll have <b>A HUGE AMOUNT</b> of information thrown at you between now and the end of the contract, and the hope is that having a page with a decent amount of that info at least somewhat organized will be helpful as we all try to process it.</p>
            <h4 class="special-note">And to be clear, this site is in no way an official Disney or Goode Time resource or stamped with anyone's seal of approval. It is merely an attempt by previous HKDL carolers to consolidate and digest the massive amount of information and advice we will receive related to this contract. If this site's info conflicts with any official Disney or Goode Time info, please prioritize what Disney or Goode Time says. Everything is subject to change!</h4>
        <h2 id="documents">Documents: a cheat sheet</h2>
            <p>In the work <strong>visa application</strong> and <strong>contract</strong> completion process, you will be asked to submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies, and some in both forms.</p>
            <p>You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL'sÂ HR department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work visas from the Immigration Dept.</p>
            <p>Eventually, when you FedEx anything to HK, make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can reimburse you.</p>
            <p>Here is a cheat sheet to help you collect the appropriate paperwork, even before you receive the official emails from HK Disney's HR peeps requesting all these items. Especially for newbies, it may take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to collect these materials now so that you have them somewhat ready when it's time to mail them or email them. You'll have to plan for at least 4-6 weeks processing time from the date you mail off your visa application materials. They actually noted 8 weeks in this year's materials, but I suspect they will find a way to expedite the process so that we can still arrive in time for our Sep 18 contract start date.</p>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need in <strong>digital form</strong>:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Copy of your passport info and signature page(s)</span></li>
                <li>(Returning carolers only) <span>Copy of your previous Hong Kong visa(s) and landing slip(s).</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your updated CV/resume</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your driver's license</span> (if you have one)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need <strong>hard copies</strong> of:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Passport-style photos</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your university degree/diploma(s) or academic transcript(s).</span> <em>(This was one of the ones that took me a hot minute to find.)</em></li>
                <li>If you have obtained a degree or higher qualifications in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong, please provide evidence and copies of your Hong Kong student visa. <em>(Probably doesn't apply to any of us.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your relevant training or professional certificate(s)</span> (if any).</li>
                <li><span>Signed reference letters,</span> orÂ copies of your signed employment contracts, staff identity cards, brochures, newspaper articles or pamphlets, etc. with your name or photos evidencing your relevant experience.</li>
                <li><span>Copies of a few of your performance photos with identifying info</span> (3 to 4 is sufficient).</li>
                <li><span>The visa applicationÂ form ID990AÂ (original required)</span>Â <em>(They will provide a link to this file, arguably the most important document of the bunch.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of yourÂ signed HKITP employment contract.</span>Â <em>(You may have to wait to receive your contract via FedEx. If time is of the essence, they will probably ask you to email them copies of all the contract pages to expedite the visa process and then bring the hard copies with you to HK to turn in during your HR orientation.)</em></li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="special-note">All of this is of course subject to change, and the info offered here is simply what previous carolers have experienced. Don't @ me if this year they suddenly require stuff that isn't listed on this webpage. ðŸ˜œ</h4>
        <h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
            <h3>Unknown "swanky" hotel, our quarantine home</h3>
                <p>This is, of course, a brand new wrinkle to the contract. Won't be able to leave the room for any reason for 14 days, with the possibility that quarantine could be lifted early.</p>
                <p>All meals will occur via room service delivery to your room. Breakfast provided by the hotel. Sounds like we will be responsible for paying for the rest of our food via our weekly 'per diem.'</p>
            <h3 id="HPRC"><a href="https://www.harbour-plaza.com/resortcity/Index-en.htm">Harbour Plaza Resort City, or HPRC</a></h3>
                <img id="viewfromHPRC" src="Assets/viewfromHPRC.jpg" alt="The view from a room at Harbour Plaza Resort City">
                <p class="img-caption">The view from a room at Harbour Plaza Resort City, where we live for the majority of the contract.</p>
                <p>Located in the Tin Shui Wai neighborhood, very close to the border with mainlaind China and the 12.5 million-person city Shenzhen, <a href="https://www.harbour-plaza.com/resortcity/Index-en.htm">HPRC</a> is our home in HK. All of HKDL's expats are housed there.</p>
                <h4>Accommodations</h4>
                    <p>We are assigned our own studio-style "serviced apartment." It usually has a queen-size bed (that is VERY firm); a kitchenette with two electric burners, a microwave, a sink, and a half-size refrigerator; a Western-style bathroom with a bathtub and shower; a small dining table; a small couch/sitting area; a television with local channels; a wifi router; a large closet; a small night table on either side of the bed; and a varying number of cabinets, drawers, and other surfaces, depending on the room.</p>
                    <p>"Serviced Apartment" basically means that you get hotel-style housekeeping twice a week on the same days each week, for example, always on Tuesdays and Saturdays. They will empty your trash, clean your bathroom/shower area, make your bed, and vacuum, but they will NOT do your dishes!</p>
                <h4>Services</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coin-operated laundry rooms are available 24 hours on floors 16, 20, 26, & 27. (Save your HK$10 coins, or just exchange for them at the front desk.)</li>
                        <li>Hotel shuttle services to TST, the airport, and even HKDL</li>
                        <li>Starbucks in the lobby</li>
                        <li>Gym, with sauna/steam room (Note: there is also gym equipment at Disney)</li>
                    </ul>
        <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
            <h3>Groceries</h3>
                <p>Park 'n' Shop - literally in the same building as our hotel. Large and generally wide selection of foods.</p>
                <p>City Super - a large, nicer grocery store with more Western options in IFC Mall in Central</p>
                <p>Elements 360 - also a larger, more Western-focused grocery located in the Elements Mall off the Kowloon MTR stop</p>
            <h3>Backstage 7-11</h3>
                <p>Your new best friend. The cashier never judges you, even though they've already seen you five times today. Solid, cheap, quick meals and snacks. Plus we get a 15% Disney employee discount on every purchase!</p>
            <h3>Disney employee canteen/cafeteria</h3>
                <p>Very cheap. Sometimes good, sometimes meh, sometimes great. Fish breakfast is a hallowed caroler rite of passage.</p>
            <h3>Restaurants</h3>
                <p>See restaurant list in the <a href="#leisure">Leisure</a> section below</p>
            <h3>Street Food</h3>
                <p>No trip to HK is complete without eating some sort of mystery street food item. Curry fish balls, random sausages, octopus, pork jerky...You've got to try something!</p>
                <p>Bubble/Boba Tea is a big business in HK, having been popularized in nearby Taiwan. You'll find boba tea everywhere.</p>
        <h2 id="transportation">Transportation, More Info Coming Soon</h2>
            <h3>MTR, Buses, Ferries, Light Rail, oh my!</h3>
            <h3>Taxis</h3>
            <h3>Uber/Ride Share</h3>
        <h2 id="money">Money/Banking</h2>
            <h3>Starting Funds</h3>
                <p>Before you fly out, I recommend contacting either your US bank or a currency exchange to get ~400-500USD worth of HK cash, if at all possible. This way you can hit the ground running, financially. The initial expenses for groceries, meals, transportation, and any necessary items (a can opener or a coffee maker, for instance) can add up fast.</p>
                <p>It sometimes takes Disney a while to deposit our salary advance into our HK accounts. (On the other hand, sometimes it happens within the first week of work.) Because of the 2-week quarantine, we don't know yet when we will set up our bank accounts. Normally we start the process on day 1 or 2 of the contract, and then it takes the bank 1-2 weeks to mail our ATM cards to Disney, at which point our stage managers deliver them to us. All this is to say...it may be a while before you have easy access to any of your Disney income or our salary advance. Best to have some HKD cash ready for those first 3-4 weeks. ðŸ˜‰</p>
                <p>Normally, one could also visit a currency exchange at the airport after you arrive in HK, but with the pandemic protocols, I don't know that we'll have that option this year. In any case, exchange rates are notoriously bad at airports. Better to acquire HKD another way.</p>
                <p>Once we have been moved to our primary housing at <a href="#HPRC">HPRC</a>, a currency exchange is conveniently very close, in the attached shopping mall, should you still need to convert funds.</p>
            <h3>Our Bank & Info You Need to Transfer Funds to the US</h3>
                <h4>Our Bank, <a href="https://www.sc.com/hk/">Standard Chartered HK</a><!--Locations?--></h4>    
                    <p>For the past four years, Disney has guided us through setting up our bank account through Standard Chartered HK. SCHK is a large, international banking corporation, like HSBC or Citibank.</p>
                    <p>Banking accounts in HK use different terminology than we do in the US. In the US, the default account most people utilize for payroll deposits and payment of regular bills is the checking account. In HK, the default account for such purposes is the <strong><em>savings</em></strong> account. Our salary will be deposited directly into our savings account at SCHK.</p>
                    <p>What we call a 'checking' account in the US is called a 'current' account in HK. Our 'current' accounts will start with (and likely remain at) HK$0. My understanding from light research is that a current account is more relevant for businesses and people who have to write checks, as checkbooks are connected to a current account but not to a savings account. It is entirely possible that you will not use/need your current account at all.</p>
                    <p>Also worth noting is that our savings accounts are also multi-currency accounts, meaning that they can hold not only HK$ but also US$ (and currency from several other financial powers like China, Singapore, Australia, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Our ATM cards can access either your savings or current accounts for withdrawals. Our ATM cards are also connected to the UnionPay financial network. UnionPay is kind of like the Visa, Mastercard, Cirrus, or Plus networks that enable you to make purchases or withdrawals anywhere those networks are accepted. Effectively, this makes your ATM work as a charge card most places where UnionPay is accepted. I've used it at grocery stores and restaurants, for example.</p>
                    <img id="unionpaylogo" src="Assets/400px-UnionPay_logo.svg.png">
                    <p class="img-caption">The UnionPay logo.</p>
                    <p>During your first few days at Disney, there will be a guided bank account sign-up session. Among other items, you will be given a small paper that contains your six-digit PIN code. Obviously, this will be a very important paper to hold onto. It can be a bit confusing to recognize its importance in the moment because you don't receive your ATM card at the same time. In fact, you may not see an ATM card for another 1-2 weeks. But you will need that PIN number to conduct any banking business, with or without the ATM card. Keep it safe!</p>
                    <p>Another item you receive during banking sign-up is a small paper that contains instructions and a personal code for signing up for online banking. Save it, and take note of it if you intend to use that feature.</p>
                <h4>Accessing/Depositing Your Salary Advance</h4>    
                    <p>At a certain point shortly after signing up for our bank accounts, we will likely receive our salary advance in the form of a check from Disney that we must deposit in order to access the funds. Direct deposit will likely not be available for this advance. Instead, bring your PASSPORT and the unendorsed check with you to a bank branch. The teller will walk you through endorsing and depositing the check. You will then be able to withdraw funds if you need them.</p>
                <h4>Account Number, Routing Number, and Your US bank SWIFT code</h4> 
                    <p>It is worth recording the following items somewhere to have them handy when you want to execute a wire transfer of funds to your US bank:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your US bank name (i.e. Bank of America or Citibank)</li>
                        <li>The account number of your US account</li>
                        <li>The routing number of your US account (usually nine digits long, found along the bottom of your checks, next to your account number. Most banks also provide this info somewhere in your online banking.)</li>
                        <li>Your US bank SWIFT/Clearing Code. This is easy to google. Or ask your bank to be sure. (Bank of America's SWIFT Code is 'BOFAUS3N,' for instance.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Visit a branch of Standard Chartered to execute a wire transfer. They will likely suggest that you convert the funds into US Dollars before transferring them. This is a good idea, as you will get a better exchange rate doing so than if you send HK Dollars to your US bank and then have them convert them into US Dollars. You will have to fill out transfer forms, verify your PIN code, and sign your name exactly as it appears on your passport. </p>
                    <h4 class="special-note">Always bring your <strong>PASSPORT</strong> when conducting any banking business in HK!</h4>
                    <p>It is also possible to conduct a wire transfer via online banking. There is no chance that I can cleanly explain it here. But I have done it: it is confusing, but possible. ðŸ˜‚ Contact me in HK if you need assistance with this, and we'll find a time to walk through the process.</p>
                    <h4>When/How Much to Transfer</h4>
                    <p>Some carolers make regular transfers throughout the contract because they have bills to be paid back home or other reasons. And some wait until the end of the contract to transfer a larger sum.</p>
                    <p>And some carolers just arrange to withdraw a large amount of US cash at the end of the contract, which they then protect with their life. It might mean stuffing large sums of cash into your pants and/or bra to take that money with you on the plane. ðŸ˜‚ I'm not kidding. Real stories here. In any case, take note that any wire transfers of $10,000 or more are supposed to be automatically reported to the IRS. As a result, people usually max out any wire transfer at $9,999.99.</p>
                    <h4>End of Contract Banking</h4>
                    <p class="special-note">It is to your advantage to convert your income into US Dollars before you leave HK. That said, arranging for your funds to be converted into USD and withdrawn/transferred can be a source of great stress at the end of the contract, both because the process requires some work on our parts and because of weekends and holidays that always coincide with the end of our contract, making it harder to nail down a time to do this banking business. Here is some of what we have learned about handling your money in this situation.</p>
                    <p>If you plan to withdraw your money in the form of USD at the end of the contract, it is likely to be a larger sum of US bills than the bank usually has available on any given day. Branches tend to have US$2500 or less available on a normal day, and you might be withdrawing several times that amount! Therefore, it is <em><strong>extremely important to call the bank branch from which you intend to withdraw A WEEK PRIOR to your withdrawal</strong></em> to let them know you plan to make a large withdrawal of USD. This head's up gives the bank time to ensure that it has enough US bills available for your withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>If, at the end of the contract, you do not alert the bank branch ahead of time, it may not have enough US bills available to convert all of your funds into USD. You will be forced to withdraw the remainder in HKD, do a wire transfer, or leave the funds in the account.</p>
                    <p class="special-note">You can always convert HKD back to USD after you return to the US, but the exchange rate is significantly better if you do it in HK, and since we are talking about large amounts of money, that difference adds up.</p>
                    <p>I have absolutely had a scenario where, at the end of the contract, I wire transferred some US funds back to my US bank, withdrew whatever USD I could, and withdrew the remainder of my funds in HKD before my account was entirely empty. I then had to find a currency exchange in HK to convert those HKD into USD before I then went to the airport to catch my flight home. It was a lot to deal with in a very compressed, stressful time frame, but it saved me a lot of money as well.</p>
                    <p>It is not strictly necessary to formally close our accounts once we have emptied them of funds. However, many carolers do just that since we never truly know if we will ever be back again, and they would rather not have an empty account in their name.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to close the account, the teller may tell you that there is a fee associated with closing an account that hasn't been open for more than a year (or six months, or whatever). But we have always been able to convince them that this fee should be waived, since we are forced to open the account as part of our necessarily short-term employment with HK Disney. The fee really isn't fair in our case, and they have never pushed back too hard when we have complained about this fee. Honestly, though, since there's no fee to keep the account open and empty, we should probably do that from now on. A much simpler solution!</p>
            <h3>Octopus Card!</h3>
                    <p>The Octopus card is a rechargeable 'smart' card that works only in Hong Kong. You load it with cash anywhere Octopus is accepted and at special "add value" machines within MTR stations. Then you can tap your Octopus on the appropriate sensors to access trains, buses, and ferries, and to make purchases at convenience stores, grocery stores, fast food and other restaurants, small shops, and more. We use it at our employee canteen/cafeteria as well. It will become one of the most important items you carry with you at all times!</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.hkfastfacts.com/octopus-card/">Here is a link</a> with more info about the Octopus card.</p>
            <h3>Taxes</h3>
                <h4 class="special-note">We will almost certainly have bigger HK tax obligations this year. Most of us owed a ridiculously small amount  (or even HK$0)last year. The Disney documentation has always suggested we withhold 16% of our income for tax purposes.</h4>
                <p>After doing some deeper research, I'll try to give us an informed estimate as to how much we are likely to owe.</p>
                <h4>US taxes on HK income</h4>
                <p>There are various ways carolers have handled their US taxes when it comes to their HK income and expenses. The main point I'll say is that it's not going to be worth the government's time and money to audit any of us over the amount of income tax we're dealing with here. So, don't let it stress you out. Get a tax pro to help if you're super concerened. I'm happy to go into far too much detail with anyone who wants to discuss how I've done it.</p>
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
            <h3>Mobile phone options</h3>
                <ol class="phone-options">
                    <li class="phone-option">You can bring an "unlocked" smartphone and purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card in HK, giving you an HK telephone number. I'm fairly certain that most, if not all, recent Verizon iPhones are "unlocked" by default. Otherwise, you'd have to do your research and possibly get some help from a technician or retailer to "unlock" your phone for use on other networks.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">Or, if you have a T-Mobile unlimited data plan, you can likely use your existing phone and native SIM card, without any addtional hassle. Ben can tell you more about this option.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">Some people have brought two phones, one being their everyday cell phone and the other usually being an older model they happen to have that they can throw an HK SIM card into.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">We did have one caroler whose phone of choice was an iPhone 4S! (Oh, Paul...) It worked, technically, but he ran into issues as we ended up downloading apps and generally using lots of bandwith and memory, straining his phone past the point of usefulness.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Apps to consider downloading</h3>    
                <ul>
                    <li>WhatsApp, if you don't have it already. It is the primary way we communicate with our stage managers and each other while we are in HK.</li>
                    <li>An exchange rate app to compare USD and HKD amounts. I like a popular one called XE.</li>
                    <li>A Cantonese-learning app. I like one called "Nemo Cantonese."</li>
                    <li>City Mapper. A great app that is often easier to use than Apple or Google Maps. Will help you navigate the city's complex public transit system like a pro.</li>
                    <li>Eventually, you may want to download our bank's mobile banking app, SCHK Mobile.</li>
                    <li>At some point during rehearsals, we will be guided through signing up for KronosMobile, Disney's HR app. It will enable you to see your advance schedule and figure out whether you forgot to clock in/clock out (not that that EVER happens, ahem).</li>

        <h2 id="performance-links">Links to Performance Video</h2>
                <p>For now, you can search YouTube for "Mickey and Friends Christmastime Ball" to see footage of our daytime show from each of the past three years (2017-2019). The show has largely remained the same each year, though it is certainly possible this year's incarnation will be different.</p>
                <p>Our evening show is called "A Holiday Wish Come True Tree Lighting Ceremony," though you may find it listed on YouTube as simply "HKDL Tree Lighting" or something like that.</p>
                <p>Finding footage of our caroling sets is going to be more difficult, especially since we ended up not doing much of that last year. But I'll find some footage eventually to include in this section.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I'll get around to adding links to and hopefully embedding some good videos of these shows on this page.</p>
        <h2 id="costume-HMU">Costume/Makeup/Hair Considerations</h2>
                <h3>Costumes</h3>
                    <p>Every last costume item is provided by Disney. You will not have to bring any costume items of your own.</p>
                <h4>Prop note: Pitchpipes</h4>
                    <p>If you own a pitchpipe (or two), pack them. Goode Time (and Disney) traditionally expect one of the boys to handle pitchpipe duties during performance. Ideally, each group has at least two pitchpipes available, in case one goes missing, is left in a costume pocket accidentally, etc.</p>
                <h3>Makeup/Hair</h3>
                    <p>Everyone will, at some point, have to do a makeup and hair consultation. Historically, the consultant looks at the men and says, "You don't need to do anything except put a little product in your hair" before turning attention to the women.</p>
                    <p>The returning ladies can shed more light on the hair and makeup situation. I know mostly that it requires significant time investment each day and that you will all become great friends with the hair team.</p>
        <h2 id="leisure">Leisure/Time Off</h2>

            <h4>We will usually have two full days off each work week, and we will earn overtime if they schedule us to work more than 5 days a week, or if they work us more than 9 hours in a work day. SO, what can we do with our down time?!?</h4>
            <h3>The big tourist stuff</h3>

            <h3>Other attractions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Central - As the name implies, this district is 'central' to just about everything that happens in HK. Central is located on the southern side of Victoria Harbour, across from TST. It contains a transportation hub, government buildings, banks, restaurants/bars, cultural hotspots, street markets, trendy shopping, fancy hotels...basically one of HK's two "downtowns," with TST being the other.</li>
                    <li>Tsim Sha Tsui, aka TST - loads of fun to be had in TST. Plus, our hotel offers a cheap, frequent shuttle that takes you directly to/from the district.</li>
                    <li>Wan Chai/Causeway Bay - Wan Chai has some 'edgier' bars and restaurants, and Causeway Bay is a shopping/food epicenter. It even has its own "Times Square."</li>
                    <li>Ocean Park - the other theme park in Hong Kong: part amusement park, part zoo, and part aquarium!</li>
                    <li>Stanley - a neighborhood in the extreme southeastern part of HK that has great ocean views, promenades, shopping, restaurants, and a prison museum</li>
                    <li>Lamma Island</li>
                    <li>Cheung Chau Island</li>
                    <li>Tai O fishing village</li>
                    <li>Sai Kung - a beautiful region in the extreme northeast part of HK featuring beaches, epic hikes, and a lively port neighborhood</li>
                    <li>Day trip to Macau - This one may not be an option this year, as it involves leaving HK. ðŸ˜­ But is is the Vegas of the East. Walk a casino floor, have a Portuguese egg tart (or seven), and see The House of Dancing Water, one of the most amazing shows you'll ever see.</li>
                </ul>  
            <h3>HK is one giant mall after another.</h3>

                    <li>ALL OF CAUSEWAY BAY</li>
                    <li>Flower Market/Bird Market</li>
                    <li>Basically every metro station is connected to a mall because the malls and the public transportation are owned by the same entity, or so I have heard.</li>
                    <li>T-Town, close to our hotel</li>
                    <li>Fortune Kingswood, <em>literally</em> connected to our hotel</li>

                    <li>Baba's Station: incredible Indian food in the smallest restaurant you've ever seen</li>
                    <li>Beef and Liberty - excellent burgers</li>
                    <li>Tim Ho Wan - cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world, great roast pork buns</li>
                    <li>Dim Dim Sum - another favorite dim sum spot</li>

            <h3>Night Life</h3>
                <h4>At the time I'm writing this, gatherings in HK are severely restricted, so it's not clear how much "night life" will be available to experience by the time we are there.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ned Kelly's Last Stand - the bandleader is one of our best friends in HK</li>
                    <li>Old Man - one of the best bars in the world</li>
                    <li>Ozone - the highest bar in the city, in the ICC building</li>
                    <li>Petticoat Lane - did someone say free vodka?</li>
                    <li>Lan Kwai Fong - the party district of HK</li>
                    <li>Miraplace in TST - cool strip of restaurants and live music clubs</li>

            <h3>Electrical concerns -- Adapters vs. Converters: what do you need?</h3>
                <h4 class="special-note">What follows is a bit of a crash course in electrics. It is admittedly a confusing subject. The tl;dr version is: Save yourself heartache by buying cheap HK versions of any appliances you might be thinking of bringing. If you must bring your American appliance, you risk frying it if is not dual-voltage or if it is not plugged into a capable electric converter. Beyond that, you almost certainly want an adapter (or two) with USB ports, but know that adapters and converters are not the same thing, though you can buy adapter/converter combos.</h4>
                <p>HK electrical outlets deliver 220V of electrical current and require plugs with the UK-style three-prong design.</p>
                <img id="outlet-plug" src="Assets/UK-outlet-plug.jpg" alt="A picture of HK/UK-standard electrical outlets and plugs">
                <p class="img-caption">This is the style of electrical outlet and plug you will find in HK.</p>
                <p>Via use of a travel adapter, you can plug American electric devices into these sockets. BUT unless the device is dual-voltage (meaning it can handle 220V) you run the risk of overloading it with more voltage than the device can handle, potentially frying your item, rendering it trash. This is because American single-voltage devices are only built to handle the American standard of 110V.</p>
                <!--<p>How do you determine whether a device is single- or dual-voltage? You have to look for the electric specs somewhere on the device. Here is what the specs look like on my Magic Bullet blender:</p>
                <img id="blender" src="" alt="Picture of Magic Bullet Blender">-->
                <p>You will likely need at least one travel adapter, and adapters are easily purchased in many places that sell electronics. An adapter:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>adapts your plug so that it will physically fit into a different style socket.</li>
                        <li>does NOT alter voltage.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Therefore, simply using an adapter will not protect your American device from potentially roasting when it is plugged into the higher voltage Hong Kong electical outlet.</p>
                <p>A voltage converter, on the other hand:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>changes voltage from 220V to the American standard of 110V, thereby protecting your devices, if the device is within the converter's power rating (measured in W, meaning 'watts')</li>
                        <li>are usually heavier, bulkier, and more expensive than adapters.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>If finding an acceptable converter sounds like a pain in the butt, you're not wrong. I found one in Hong Kong my first year. I used it for multiple contracts, but really I was only using it to convert voltage for my American-made Magic Bullet blender. Turned out I didn't need the converter for my laptop or phone charger, both of which were dual-voltage and needed only an adapter. Because I used my blender very little last year, I eventually gave away my voltage converter so that I wouldn't have to keep lugging around the extra ten pounds each contract. Sure, the converter did the job, but it was ten pounds!</p>
                <p>Appliances are plentiful in HK, and they are easy for us to dispose of when the contract is done. (See #Dozo.) There is a glorious store called Mini So (which probably requires its own section of this webpage) where I plan to purchase a cheap personal blender this year. Single-cup coffee maker, alarm clock, personal scale, bluetooth speakers, all manner of small appliances--already calibrated for HK voltage--they can all be found in HK fairly easily.</p>
                <p>So, after going down the converter route for multiple contracts, I have decided to go adapter-only this year.</p>
                <p>That said, here are some Amazon links to converter/adapter combos that some vets have suggested:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/2000W-Travel-Adapter-Converter-Combo/dp/B088WQ1VNB/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=power%20converter%20doace&qid=1595986488&sr=8-7&fbclid=IwAR0ZJX9JWxrIURPxjJPNpyOaNBsYUx3m7s8ByDEBqeCfeX97hUys6NUQXlg" target=_blank>This one</a> should handle single-voltage electric items with a power rating of 26-2000W. That covers a lot of hair dryers, but according to its safety information, it "CAN NOT work with electronic controlled devices that are controlled by digital chips Which has auto shut-off, timer, temperature control, pulse, touch screen function such as Hair Straightener, Flat Iron, Curling iron, CPAP machine, Drill Battery, Coffee Machine, Blender, Heating Pad and so on. ###Converter Mode Can Not be used with low-wattage appliances (0-25W). Such as Hair Clipper, Electric Shaver, Electric Toothbrush and Dental Flossing Machine." </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-Universal-Converter-Charging-Worldwide/dp/B01E140XWA/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=power%20converter&qid=1595986712&sr=8-5&fbclid=IwAR3Kh-AUpSHL3jrm8FJxZzEvK_x1p6yhDlcsDO-IF2dTGRVSfxVrBlr8orc" target=_blank>Here is another</a> that has USB ports, but it specifically states that it is not compatible with hair dryers or any other device that is above 200W. That rules out a lot of medium-to-heavy-duty devices.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DQTL87X/ref=cm_sw_r_fm_api_i_x0niFb2EJV4XT?fbclid=IwAR1WW9BvGCjO1uFaeid6cQ2i_8j8XBxUHeVBujGBlFV9aLo45Tp3-Ka6QxI&th=1" target=_blank>One more with USB ports</a> with mostly positive reviews, but several point out that heavy duty hair dryers blew out the fuse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="special-note">Deciding whether you need an electrical converter or merely a travel adapter depends on what devices you intend to bring with you from the US. If they can handle 220V, then an adapter is all you need. If they can't handle 220V, you'd have to use a converter that can accommodate your device. This means the converter's power rating (26W-2000W, for instance) includes that of your device (For instance, my Magic Bullet blender generates 150W.) You have to check your device's electrical label to know how many W it generates.</p>
        <h3>Some non-obvious items you may want to consider packing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dish towels/dish drying mat (none are provided)</li>
                <li>Preferred pain/cold meds</li>
                <li>Voice remedies like Singerâ€™s Saving Grace, etc. </li>
                <li>Dried spices/herbs, if you cook a lot</li>
                <li>Lightweight bowl(s)/mixing bowl (The ones the hotel provides are pretty small.)</li>
                <li>Can opener</li>
                <li>Wine opener</li>
                <li>Coin purse/pouch (Coins are useful and accumulate quickly in HK)</li>
                <li>Laundry detergent pods, if you have a strong preference in detergent</li>
                <li>Preferred vitamins/supplements/protein powder</li>
                <li>Paper copy of your Passport/Birth Certificate/SS Card/Driverâ€™s License. In the unfortunate event you lose your passport, copies of these items can help speed up your process of getting a replacement at an embassy/consulate.</li>
                <li>Extra passport photos and US cash (Originally these were useful for traveling in the area either during or after the contract, but that is probably not an option this year. That said, extra photos (and a copy of your ID docs, see previous item) could be helpful if you lose your passport. And US cash is still a very valuable commodity. Always have some extra US cash for an emergency.</li>
                <li>HDMI cable for connecting laptop to TV to watch Netflix etc.</li>
                <li>Not just good but GREAT walking shoes. You will walk all over the place.</li>
                <li>Compact grocery bags or totes (plastic bags cost extra at most grocery stores)</li>
                <li>Small tupperware (for packing meals/leftovers)</li>
                <li>Extra stick deodorant, if that is your preferred style of deodorant. It is hard to find in HK, for whatever reason.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Some items you should probably leave at home</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromecasts/Apple TV/Amazon Fire Sticks/Roku/Etc. (They canâ€™t connect over our foreign- & hotel-based WiFi)</li>
                <li>Playstation, XBox, or other large electronic items (power and compatibility issues, even with a converter)</li>
                <li>Heavy winter wear. It will be in the 60s-80s during October/November and will be 50s-70s in December. Leave the snow parka at home. But bring layers, a warm scarf, gloves, and a compact fleece or light coat for those late December nights when it can still get pretty chilly.</li>
                <li>Mass quantities of dress clothes/shoes. Unless you plan to hit the clubs in Lan Kwai Fong on the regular or just love wearing nice things, you likely wonâ€™t have much occasion to wear nice clothes. 98% of the time, we wear comfy, casual clothes--or our costumes. (DO BRING at least one 'business-casual,' outfit you can wear on the very few occasions when Disney Look is required. Basically anything that's not jeans or flip-flops.) All this said, if Morgan comes up with another 'Ho Lang, Bitch' to perform at Petticoat Lane, FIERCE LEWKS will be encouraged ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º. So, bring a handful of nicer outfits, but thatâ€™s likely all youâ€™ll need.</li>
                <li>We have managed to see some Halloween costumes broken out in previous years. Like everything this year, I'm sure Halloween will look different, but if you have a creative costume idea that you can pack, you may well get the opportunity to show it off. ðŸŽƒ</li>
