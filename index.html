        <h2 id="first">First Things First</h2>
            <p>Welcome, carolers! I thought a reference website could be helpful as newbies and vets alike try to learn/remember what this contract requires of us.</p>
            <p>First off, congratulations on earning this contract. Almost everyone who has done it considers it a highlight of their career and life. Hong Kong is an amazing city, and the people are equally amazing. There are too many good things about this contract to cover in one place!</p>
            <p>The point of this site is to have an easy resource for lots of info about the contract, as shared by those who have done the contract before. You'll have <b>A HUGE AMOUNT</b> of information thrown at you between now and the end of the contract, and the hope is that having a page with a decent amount of that info at least somewhat organized will be helpful as we all try to process it.</p>
            <h4 class="special-note">And to be clear, this site is in no way an official Disney or Goode Time resource or stamped with anyone's seal of approval. It is merely an attempt by previous HKDL carolers to consolidate and digest the massive amount of information and advice we will receive related to this contract. If this site's info conflicts with any official Disney or Goode Time info, please prioritize what Disney or Goode Time says. Everything is subject to change!</h4>
        <h2 id="documents">Documents: a cheat sheet</h2>
            <p>In the work <strong>visa application</strong> and <strong>contract</strong> completion process, you will be asked to submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies, and some in both forms.</p>
            <p>You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL's HR department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work visas from the Immigration Dept.</p>
            <p>Eventually, when you FedEx anything to HK, make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can reimburse you.</p>
            <p>Here is a cheat sheet to help you collect the appropriate paperwork, even before you receive the official emails from HK Disney's HR peeps requesting all these items. Especially for newbies, it may take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to collect these materials now so that you have them somewhat ready when it's time to mail them or email them. You'll have to plan for at least 4-6 weeks processing time from the date you mail off your visa application materials. They actually noted 8 weeks in this year's materials, but I suspect they will find a way to expedite the process so that we can still arrive in time for our Sep 18 contract start date.</p>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need in <strong>digital form</strong>:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Copy of your passport info and signature page(s)</span></li>
                <li>(Returning carolers only) <span>Copy of your previous Hong Kong visa(s) and landing slip(s).</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your updated CV/resume</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your driver's license</span> (if you have one)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need <strong>hard copies</strong> of:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Passport-style photos</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your university degree/diploma(s) or academic transcript(s).</span> <em>(This was one of the ones that took me a hot minute to find.)</em></li>
                <li>If you have obtained a degree or higher qualifications in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong, please provide evidence and copies of your Hong Kong student visa. <em>(Probably doesn't apply to any of us.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your relevant training or professional certificate(s)</span> (if any).</li>
                <li><span>Signed reference letters,</span> or copies of your signed employment contracts, staff identity cards, brochures, newspaper articles or pamphlets, etc. with your name or photos evidencing your relevant experience.</li>
                <li><span>Copies of a few of your performance photos with identifying info</span> (3 to 4 is sufficient).</li>
                <li><span>The visa application form ID990A (original required)</span> <em>(They will provide a link to this file, arguably the most important document of the bunch.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your signed HKITP employment contract.</span> <em>(You may have to wait to receive your contract via FedEx. If time is of the essence, they will probably ask you to email them copies of all the contract pages to expedite the visa process and then bring the hard copies with you to HK to turn in during your HR orientation.)</em></li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="special-note">All of this is of course subject to change, and the info offered here is simply what previous carolers have experienced. Don't @ me if this year they suddenly require stuff that isn't listed on this webpage. 😜</h4>
        <h2 id="flights">Flight Stuff</h2>
            <h3>When will we get the info?</h3>
                <p>Traditionally, we receive our flight information within 72 hours of our flight date. Tony says our flight date this year should be Friday, Sept. 18, the same as the first day of our contract. However, if Disney books our flights the way they have in the past, our flight may well leave as early as Wednesday, Sept. 16th (which would have us arrive in HK on Sept. 17).</p>
                <p>All this means is that your flight info will likely not arrive before Sept. 13th or so. Check with your fellow carolers. If they have all received their flight info and you have not, it is worth following up with HK Disney HR to ensure your flight info is on its way.</p>
            <h3>Change your seat!</h3>
                <p>This probably isn't as much a concern this year, as fewer people are likely to be on your flight. Nonetheless, once Disney sends you your flight info, you may be able to change your seat to one you more prefer. May as well be as comfortable as possible for the long flight(s)!</p>    
            <h3>Baggage</h3>
                <p>Your baggage allowance will be determined by the airline of your flight. Since Disney controls the booking process, you don't really have a say in which airline is chosen.</p>
                <p>Historically, I have traveled with 2 rolling suitcases/bags, a medium-sized duffle bag, and a medium-sized backpack. It's basically as much as I can handle by myself. I really don't recommend bringing so much that you need one of those luggage carts at the airport. Remember, you can buy just about ANYTHING in HK, so if you don't need it, consider leaving it at home. Keep your luggage manageable. Number one rule of travelling: don't overpack.</p>
            <h3>Luggage fees</h3>
                <p>Similarly, any luggage fees for your flight will depend on the airline you are flying.</p>
            <h3>In-flight entertainment</h3>
                <p>Once you know your airline, you might want to check their website to determine whether they require you to download an app to access in-flight movies/entertainment. I believe such an app is necessary on United flights. Cathay Pacific, on the other hand, does not require you to download an app.</p>
            <h3>Frequent Flier program</h3>
                <p>It may be a different world with less travelling, but a flight to HK is still a huge number of miles. Take advantage of your airline's frequent flier program and ensure that your flight(s) counts toward your miles!</p>
            <h3>COVID-related flying info</h3>
                <p>If you know of any particular protocols or lack thereof being practiced by airlines, let us know so we can include it here.</p>
            <h3>Arrival in HK, COVID testing/protocol</h3>
                <p>Morgan's report via our friend in HK and former face character, Rachel Capp: "We will be at the airport for like 3-4 hours once we land in their facility hall to get tested, get our wellness app together and basically a house arrest bracelet for quarantine so just mentally prepare now it might be a long day. So I’d pack snacks and like things to make the waiting more comfortable."</p>
                <p>I've also seen many people report that the waiting hall in heavily air conditioned, so be sure to have a sweater or light jacket in your carry-on luggage. Some have suggested bringing a yoga mat so that you can lie down, rather than sit in the same plastic chair for 3-4 hours.</p>        
        <h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
            <h3>Unknown "swanky" hotel, our quarantine home</h3>
                <p>This is, of course, a brand new wrinkle to the contract. Won't be able to leave the room for any reason for 14 days, with the possibility that quarantine could be lifted early.</p>
                <p>All meals will occur via room service delivery to your room. Breakfast provided by the hotel. Sounds like we will be responsible for paying for the rest of our food via our weekly 'per diem.'</p>

            <h3 id="HPRC"><a href="https://www.harbour-plaza.com/resortcity/Index-en.htm">Harbour Plaza Resort City, or HPRC</a></h3>
                <img id="viewfromHPRC" src="Assets/viewfromHPRC.jpg" alt="The view from a room at Harbour Plaza Resort City">
                <p class="img-caption">The view from a room at Harbour Plaza Resort City, where we live for the majority of the contract.</p>
                <p>Located in the Tin Shui Wai neighborhood, very close to the border with mainlaind China and the 12.5 million-person city Shenzhen, <a href="https://www.harbour-plaza.com/resortcity/Index-en.htm">HPRC</a> is our home in HK. All of HKDL's expats are housed there.</p>
                <h4>Accommodations</h4>
                    <p>We are assigned our own studio-style "serviced apartment." It usually has a queen-size bed (that is VERY firm); a kitchenette with two electric burners, a microwave, a sink, and a half-size refrigerator; a Western-style bathroom with a bathtub and shower; a small dining table; a small couch/sitting area; a television with local channels; a wifi router; a large closet; a small night table on either side of the bed; and a varying number of cabinets, drawers, and other surfaces, depending on the room.</p>
                    <p>"Serviced Apartment" basically means that you get hotel-style housekeeping twice a week on the same days each week, for example, always on Tuesdays and Saturdays. They will empty your trash, clean your bathroom/shower area, make your bed, and vacuum, but they will NOT do your dishes!</p>
                <h4>Services</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coin-operated laundry rooms are available 24 hours on floors 16, 20, 26, & 27. (Save your HK$10 coins, or just exchange for them at the front desk.)</li>
                        <li>Hotel shuttle services to TST, the airport, and even HKDL</li>
                        <li>Starbucks in the lobby</li>
                        <li>Gym, with sauna/steam room (Note: there is also gym equipment at Disney)</li>
                    </ul>
        <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
            <h3>Groceries</h3>
                <p>Park 'n' Shop - literally in the same building as our hotel. Large and generally wide selection of foods.</p>
                <p>City Super - a large, nicer grocery store with more Western options in IFC Mall in Central</p>
                <p>Elements 360 - also a larger, more Western-focused grocery located in the Elements Mall off the Kowloon MTR stop</p>
            <h3>Backstage 7-11</h3>
                <p>Your new best friend. The cashier never judges you, even though they've already seen you five times that day. Solid, cheap, quick meals and snacks. Plus we get a 15% Disney employee discount on every purchase!</p>
            <h3>Disney employee canteen/cafeteria</h3>
                <p>Very cheap. Sometimes good, sometimes meh, sometimes great. Fish breakfast is a hallowed caroler rite of passage.</p>
            <h3>Restaurants</h3>
                <p>See restaurant list in the <a href="#leisure">Leisure</a> section below</p>
            <h3>Street Food</h3>
                <p>No trip to HK is complete without eating some sort of mystery street food item. Curry fish balls, bubble waffles, random bao, octopus, pork jerky...You've got to try something!</p>
                <p>Bubble/Boba Tea is a big business in HK, having been popularized in nearby Taiwan. You'll find boba tea everywhere. I recommend Tiger Sugar or ShareTea.</p>
        <h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>
            <h3>MTR, Buses, Ferries, Light Rail, Trams, oh my!</h3>
                <h4>HK has some of the most efficient and reliable public transportation in the entire world.</h4>
                <p>The train system is known as the 'MTR.' It is extremely modern and very easy to navigate, with lots of clear signage and color-coded train lines. <a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tourist/index.php">Here is a link</a> to the MTR's website.</p>
                <p>HK also has a robust public bus system that operates all over the territory. There are mulitple bus companies that operate different styles of bus routes. Some are large double decker vehicles that operate local and express routes covering large sections of HK. Some are 14-seat mini-buses that operate more confined routes. And some are direct service from one district to another. <a href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hongkong/transportation/town-bus.htm">Here is a link</a> providing a broad overview of the HK bus system.</p>
                <p>Ferries are a popular way to move across HK's many waterways. Perhaps the most popular one is the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbour, which takes you from Central to TST and vice-versa. The cost is stupid cheap, and the view is great. You can also use ferries to visit some of the popular outlying islands, like Lamma Island or Cheung Chau Island.</p>
                <p>The light rail system is another "lighter" train network (almost a cross between trains and trams) that we will encounter a lot near our hotel in Tin Shui Wai. It stops more frequently than the MTR trains and connects our neighborhood to the nearest MTR station. It is also quite cheap and accepts Octopus card payment. Our hotel is located adjacent to the 'Ginza' light rail station. From there, it is a short trip on the light rail to 'Tin Shui Wai,' where we can connect to the larger Tin Shui Wai MTR station.
                </p>
                <p>There is a fun tram system known as the 'Ding Ding' that operates along the northern end of Hong Kong Island. It is extremely cheap, and it can be a very fun way to see this vibrant part of HK. Highly recommend taking at least one ride on the Ding Ding.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/hong-kong-taxi-guide-1535884">Taxis</a></h3>
                    <h4 class="special-note">No one uses the term 'cab' in HK. Only 'taxi.'</h4>
                    <h4>HK taxis come in three varieties: blue, green, and red.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blue taxis operate only within Lantau Island (where Disney and the airport are).</li>
                            <li>Green taxis operate only within the New Territories (basically anywhere that isn't on Hong Kong Island, where Central is).</li>
                            <li>Red taxis operate anywhere in Hong Kong. </li>
                                <p>Some taxis prefer to stay near Central and will sometimes refuse to take your fare if you want to cross the Harbour. My understanding is that this practice is technically illegal, so it often helps to get into the taxi before announcing your destination so that they are more committed to your fare before they know where they are taking you. Even so, some particularly difficult drivers will tell you to get out if they really don't want to go to your destination.</p>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Taxis in HK accept cash, and like many vendors, they will often round down to the nearest HK Dollar. They sometimes can be short on change, so best to have small bills or coins handy so that you can complete your transaction. I have never seen a credit card used in an HK cab.</p>
                    <p>When we have early morning or late night rehearsals or performances, there will not be a Disney-provided bus to transport us to/from work. In those situations, we will take taxis. We generally take turns paying the full cab fare. <em><strong>Always get a receipt from the driver if you pay for a taxi ride.</strong></em> Then you can submit a reimbursement form for that taxi ride. You may well submit receipts for several taxi fares at the same time.</p>    
            <h3>Uber/Ride Share</h3>
                    <p>While Uber and other ride-share companies operate in HK, they are not as popular as they are in other major cities. This is because HK has one of the best public transportation networks in the world and also because taxis in HK are relatively cheap compared to taxis in other major cities.</p>
                    <p>One advantage to using an Uber/ride-share app is that your route is pre-determined. There are definitely taxi drivers in HK who will try to take advantage of your foreigner naivete by taking an extended route to inflate your fare. Using an Uber avoids this potential pitfall.</p>
            <h3>Walking in HK</h3>
                <p>Walking in HK is a workout! Particularly in Central, where the streets can be quite steep, good shoes are extremely important.</p>
                <p>Pedestrian overpasses take a little while to get used to in HK. Ultimately, they keep pedestrians from clogging major vehicle-heavy thoroughfares, so they are a huge benefit to the city's overall flow. But until you've learned to locate and navigate with them, you will occasionally find yourself trying to cross an uncrossable street. You might have to backtrack until you find the staircase that leads to the appropriate pedestrian overpass or 'subway' (which is the term they use for a literal 'way underneath something.' Trains are not really referred to as 'subways' in HK). Alternatively, you may have to walk far away from your intended path to find a crosswalk.</p>
        <h2 id="money">Money/Banking</h2>
            <h3>Starting Funds</h3>
                <p>Before you fly out, I recommend contacting either your US bank or a currency exchange to get ~400-500USD worth of HK cash, if at all possible. This way you can hit the ground running, financially. The initial expenses for groceries, meals, transportation, and any necessary items (a can opener or a coffee maker, for instance) can add up fast.</p>
                <p>It sometimes takes Disney a while to deposit our salary advance into our HK accounts. (On the other hand, sometimes it happens within the first week of work.) Because of the 2-week quarantine, we don't know yet when we will set up our bank accounts. Normally we start the process on day 1 or 2 of the contract, and then it takes the bank 1-2 weeks to mail our ATM cards to Disney, at which point our stage managers deliver them to us. All this is to say...it may be a while before you have easy access to any of your Disney income or our salary advance. Best to have some HKD cash ready for those first 3-4 weeks. 😉</p>
                <p>Normally, one could also visit a currency exchange at the airport after you arrive in HK, but with the pandemic protocols, I don't know that we'll have that option this year. In any case, exchange rates are notoriously bad at airports. Better to acquire HKD another way.</p>
                <p>Once we have been moved to our primary housing at <a href="#HPRC">HPRC</a>, a currency exchange is conveniently very close, in the attached shopping mall, should you still need to convert funds.</p>
            <h3>Our Bank & Info You Need to Transfer Funds to the US</h3>
                <h4>Our Bank, <a href="https://www.sc.com/hk/">Standard Chartered HK</a><!--Locations?--></h4>    
                    <p>For the past four years, Disney has guided us through setting up our bank accounts with Standard Chartered HK. SCHK is a large, international banking corporation, like HSBC or Citibank.</p>
                    <p>Banking accounts in HK use different terminology than we do in the US. In the US, the default account most people utilize for payroll deposits and payment of regular bills is the checking account. In HK, the default account for such purposes is the <strong><em>savings</em></strong> account. Our salary will be deposited directly into our savings account at SCHK.</p>
                    <p>What we call a 'checking' account in the US is called a 'current' account in HK. Our 'current' accounts will start with (and likely remain at) HK$0. My understanding from light research is that a current account is more relevant for businesses and people who have to write checks, as checkbooks are connected to a current account but not to a savings account. It is entirely possible that you will not use/need your current account at all.</p>
                    <p>Also worth noting is that our savings accounts are also multi-currency accounts, meaning that they can hold not only HK$ but also US$ (and currency from several other financial powers like China, Singapore, Australia, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Our ATM cards can access either your savings or current accounts for withdrawals. Our ATM cards are also connected to the UnionPay financial network. UnionPay is kind of like the Visa, Mastercard, Cirrus, or Plus networks that enable you to make purchases or withdrawals anywhere those networks are accepted. Effectively, this makes your ATM card work as a charge card most places where UnionPay is accepted. I've used it at grocery stores and restaurants, for example.</p>

                    <p>During your first few days at Disney, there will be a guided bank account sign-up session. Among other items, you will be given a small paper that contains your six-digit PIN code. Obviously, this will be a very important paper to hold onto. It can be a bit confusing to recognize its importance in the moment because you don't receive your ATM card at the same time. In fact, you may not see an ATM card for another 1-2 weeks. But you will need that PIN number to conduct any banking business, with or without the ATM card. Keep it safe!</p>
                    <p>Another item you receive during banking sign-up is a small paper that contains instructions and a personal code for signing up for online banking. Save it, and take note of it if you intend to use that feature.</p>
                <h4>Accessing/Depositing Your Salary Advance</h4>    
                    <p>At a certain point shortly after signing up for our bank accounts, we will likely receive our salary advance in the form of a check from Disney that we must deposit in order to access the funds. Direct deposit will likely not be available for this advance. Instead, bring your PASSPORT and the unendorsed check with you to a bank branch. The teller will walk you through endorsing and depositing the check. You will then be able to withdraw funds if you need them.</p>
                <h4>Account Number, Routing Number, and Your US bank SWIFT code</h4> 
                    <p>It is worth recording the following items somewhere to have them handy when you want to execute a wire transfer of funds to your US bank:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your US bank name (i.e. Bank of America or Citibank)</li>
                        <li>The account number of your US account</li>
                        <li>The routing number of your US account (usually nine digits long, found along the bottom of your checks, next to your account number. Most banks also provide this info somewhere in your online banking.)</li>
                        <li>Your US bank SWIFT/Clearing Code. This is easy to google. Or ask your bank to be sure. (Bank of America's SWIFT Code is 'BOFAUS3N,' for instance.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Visit a branch of Standard Chartered to execute a wire transfer. They will likely suggest that you convert the funds into US Dollars before transferring them. This is a good idea, as you will get a better exchange rate doing so than if you send HK Dollars to your US bank and then have them convert them into US Dollars. You will have to fill out transfer forms, verify your PIN code, and sign your name exactly as it appears on your passport. </p>
                    <h4 class="special-note">Always bring your <strong>PASSPORT</strong> when conducting any banking business in HK!</h4>
                    <p>It is also possible to conduct a wire transfer via online banking. There is no chance that I can cleanly explain it here. But I have done it: it is confusing, but possible. 😂 Contact me in HK if you need assistance with this, and we'll find a time to walk through the process.</p>
                    <h4>When/How Much to Transfer</h4>
                    <p>Some carolers make regular transfers throughout the contract because they have bills to be paid back home. And some wait until the end of the contract to transfer a larger sum.</p>
                    <p>And some carolers just arrange to withdraw a large amount of US cash at the end of the contract, which they then protect with their life. It might mean stuffing large sums of cash into your pants and/or bra to take that money with you on the plane. 😂 I'm not kidding. Real stories here. In any case, take note that any wire transfers of $10,000 or more are supposed to be automatically reported to the IRS. As a result, people usually max out any wire transfer at $9,999.99.</p>
                    <h4>End of Contract Banking</h4>
                    <p class="special-note">It is to your advantage to convert your income into US Dollars before you leave HK. That said, arranging for your funds to be converted into USD and withdrawn/transferred can be a source of great stress at the end of the contract, both because the process requires some work on our parts and because of weekends and holidays that always coincide with the end of our contract, making it harder to nail down a time to do this banking business. Here is some of what we have learned about handling your money in this situation.</p>
                    <p>If you plan to withdraw your money in the form of USD at the end of the contract, it is likely to be a larger sum of US bills than the bank usually has available on any given day. Branches tend to have US$2500 or less available on a normal day, and you might be withdrawing several times that amount! Therefore, it is <em><strong>extremely important to call the bank branch from which you intend to withdraw A WEEK PRIOR to your withdrawal</strong></em> to let them know you plan to make a large withdrawal of USD. This head's up gives the bank time to ensure that it has enough US bills available for your withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>If, at the end of the contract, you do not alert the bank branch ahead of time, it may not have enough US bills available to convert all of your funds into USD. You will be forced to withdraw the remainder in HKD, do a wire transfer, or leave the funds in the account.</p>
                    <p class="special-note">You can always convert HKD back to USD after you return to the US, but the exchange rate is significantly better if you do it in HK, and since we are talking about large amounts of money, that difference adds up.</p>
                    <p>I have absolutely had a scenario where, at the end of the contract, I wire transferred some US funds back to my US bank, withdrew whatever USD I could, and withdrew the remainder of my funds in HKD before my account was entirely empty. I then had to find a currency exchange in HK to convert those HKD into USD before I then went to the airport to catch my flight home. It was a lot to deal with in a very compressed, stressful time frame, but it saved me a lot of money as well.</p>
                    <p>It is not strictly necessary to formally close our accounts once we have emptied them of funds. However, many carolers do just that since we never truly know if we will ever be back again, and many would rather not have an empty account in their name.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to close the account, the teller may tell you that there is a fee associated with closing an account that hasn't been open for more than a year (or six months, or whatever). But we have always been able to convince them that this fee should be waived, since we are forced to open the account as part of our necessarily short-term employment with HK Disney. The fee really isn't fair in our case, and they have never pushed back too hard when we have complained about this fee. Honestly, though, since there's no fee to keep the account open and empty, I will probably do that from now on. A much simpler solution!</p>
            <h3>Octopus Card!</h3>
                    <p>The Octopus card is a rechargeable 'smart' card that works only in Hong Kong. You load it with cash anywhere Octopus is accepted and at special "add value" machines within MTR stations. Then you can tap your Octopus on the appropriate sensors to access trains, buses, and ferries, and to make purchases at convenience stores, grocery stores, fast food and other restaurants, small shops, and more. We use it at our employee canteen/cafeteria as well. It will become one of the most important items you carry with you at all times!</p>

            <h3>Taxes</h3>
                <h4 class="special-note">We will almost certainly have bigger HK tax obligations this year. Most of us owed a ridiculously small amount  (or even HK$0) last year. The Disney documentation has always suggested we withhold 16% of our income for tax purposes.</h4>
                <p>After doing some deeper research, I'll try to give us an informed estimate as to how much we are likely to owe.</p>
                <h4>US taxes on HK income</h4>
                <p>There are various ways carolers have handled their US taxes when it comes to their HK income and expenses. The main point I'll say is that it's not going to be worth the government's time and money to audit any of us over the amount of income tax we're dealing with here. So, don't let it stress you out. Get a tax pro to help if you're super concerned. I'm happy to go into far too much detail with anyone who wants to discuss how I've done it.</p>
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
            <h3>Mobile phone options</h3>
                <ol class="phone-options">
                    <li class="phone-option">You can bring an "unlocked" smartphone and purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card in HK, giving you an HK telephone number. I'm fairly certain that most, if not all, recent Verizon iPhones are "unlocked" by default. Otherwise, you'd have to do your research and possibly get some help from a technician or retailer to "unlock" your phone for use on other networks.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">Or, if you have a T-Mobile unlimited data plan, you can likely use your existing phone and native SIM card, without any addtional hassle. Ben can tell you more about this option.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">Some people have brought two phones, one being their everyday cell phone and the other usually being an older model they happen to have that they can throw an HK SIM card into.</li>
                    <li class="phone-option">We did have one caroler whose phone of choice was an iPhone 4S! (Oh, Paul...) It worked, technically, but he ran into issues as we ended up downloading apps and generally using lots of bandwith and memory, straining his phone past the point of usefulness.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Apps to consider downloading</h3>    
                <ul>
                    <li>WhatsApp, if you don't have it already. It is the primary way we communicate with our stage managers and each other while we are in HK.</li>
                    <li>An exchange rate app to compare USD and HKD amounts. I like a popular one called XE.</li>
                    <li>A Cantonese-learning app. I like one called "Nemo Cantonese."</li>
                    <li>City Mapper. A great app that is often easier to use than Apple or Google Maps. Will help you navigate the city's complex public transit system like a pro.</li>
                    <li>Eventually, you may want to download our bank's mobile banking app, SCHK Mobile.</li>
                    <li>At some point during rehearsals, we will be guided through signing up for KronosMobile, Disney's HR app. It will enable you to see your advance schedule and figure out whether you forgot to clock in/clock out (not that that EVER happens, ahem).</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>VPNs - do you need one?</h3>
                <p>For the most part, our wifi and internet access has been fairly solid in HK, both at our hotel and at Disney. That said, mainland China continues to exert its influence (and attempts to censor) in HK, and it is potentially a very useful investment to have a VPN on your device(s).</p>
                <p>VPNs are "virtual private networks" that mask your internet address so that it appears you are accessing a network from a different location: New York City instead of Hong Kong, for example.</p>
                <p>Using a VPN enables you to access sites that might otherwise be blocked in your location. For instance, the New York State Health Department website will not allow me to sign in if the computer has a network address currently originating in Hong Kong. I am only able to sign in on that website by using a VPN to mask my actual network address (HK) and instead mimic an address from somewhere within the US.</p>
                <p>A more common example we often encounter is that Netflix's offerings are different in different countries. So your favorite Netflix show might not be available on HK Netflix. If you use a VPN to mimic a US network address however, US Netflix offerings will be available again. (Of course, sometimes, HK Netflix has shows you <em>wish</em> were available on US Netflix, so it works both ways.)</p>

            <h3 >Links to Performance Video</h3>
                <p>Here is footage of our daytime show, "Mickey and Friends Christmastime Ball," from 2018. The show has largely remained the same each year, though the choreography and staging always changes a bit. It is certainly possible this year's incarnation could be signficantly different, but until we know more, this video is a solid representation of what to expect from this show.</p>
                <div class="video-holder"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJgOeaqr7iQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p>Our evening show is called "A Holiday Wish Come True Tree Lighting Ceremony," though you may find it listed on YouTube as simply "HKDL Tree Lighting" or something like that. Here is the version from 2019. Like the daytime show, this show has not changed enormously over the years, though anything is possible this year.</p>
                <div class="video-holder"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/di1Xh0MFqPc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/EhtzCbTI7tQ">Here is a better shot video from a 2016 performance.</a> The owner of the video has made it so that I can't embed this video, but it still gives you another perspective on this show. There are several other versions on YouTube as well.</p>
                <p>Finding footage of our caroling sets is going to be more difficult, especially since we ended up not doing much of that last year. But I'll find some footage eventually to include in this section.</p>
            <h3>Quartets</h3>
                <p>We will eventually be assigned to quartets. The HKDL creative team decides the personnel in each quartet. Historically, they've been decisive about this, though they don't explicitly tell us why they make the choices they do. Maybe they don't want everyone in a given quartet to have the same color hair. Maybe they don't want three tall people with one shorter person. Maybe they want to match veteran carolers with rookies.</p>
                <p>The reality is that once the quartets are set, your fellow quartet members are the carolers you will spend time with most often. When one group is off, the other group is working. Occasionally, if someone is sick, Disney may rotate in that person's counterpart from the other quartet for a shift or two. But quartets have never been reassigned after they are set. Sometimes they make this decision early in the rehearsal process, and other years, they wait until the week before tech to set the quartets.</p>
                <p>During my first year, we had one bass-tenor duo who wanted to perform together but were assigned to different quartets. They requested that the quartets be changed so that they could be in the same quartet, but Disney did not agree to it. What Disney did agree to, however, were two weeks when the tenor switched his two days off with his counterpart in the other group. This effectively gave the bass-tenor duo four shifts when they could perform together.</p>
            <h3>Rehearsals, Performance Decisions, Authority/Working Together, Goode Time Rep, & Disney Christmas Shows</h3>
                <h4>Who's in charge of us, vocally??</h4>
                    <p>While HK Disney's music director, Ceejay, is our music director, he will usually focus much more on the Disney shows (Tree-Lighting and Christmastime Ball, for instance) and give us only limited guidance on our Goode Time repetoire. Maybe he'll tune pitch or fix the blend in obvious problem areas, but we are generally expected to know our rep very well and be ready with it at a moment's notice. Some years, maybe only one week into the contract, we will sing a song or two for Disney executives as a treat for them as they discuss the upcoming Christmas season. So, ideally, you are ready and comfortable with the Goode Time rep from the moment we start working.</p>
                    <p>We usually have a good amount of "self-rehearsal" time baked into our schedule. We use this time to work on any material we feel we need to rehearse, including the Goode Time rep. The issue that comes up is that our quartets are often not yet set when we have these self-rehearsals. That means rehearsing the Goode Time material during "self-rehearsal" feels weird. You don't want to practice gelling with people if you're not actually going to be singing with them because they are eventually assigned to another quartet.</p>
                    <p>As a result, we often devote a lot of self-rehearsal time to practicing the Tree Lighting and Christmastime Ball music. And as well we should: without a doubt Disney cares more about those shows than they do us performing acappella sets on Main Street or in the Disneyland Hotel.</p>
                    <p>However, the trap that results is that we end up not rehearsing our Goode Time rep with our quartet often, despite having lots of 'self-rehearsal' time. This has caused challenges in the past, where the material just isn't as performance-ready as it should be. It's up to us to find time to rehearse Goode Time material that needs rehearsing once we are in HK. Find time at Disney to warm up together, at least for a song or two. And take advantage of self-rehearsal opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Because the music director is fairly hands off when it comes to our Goode Time rep, we are generally trusted to monitor ourselves when it comes to quality and set selection. While we will always have a Disney 'lead' or 'greeter' with us when we carol on Main Street or in the Disneyland Hotel, and while we will know the length of our sets, they won't dictate what we sing or, frankly, care how we sound. It will be up to us what we choose to sing and to ensure it is Disney-standard quality.</p>
                    <p class="special-note">Take Note: On the other hand, there is MUCH attention paid to our vocals when we are performing anything that isn't the Goode Time rep. Ceejay will usually gives us notes after every run or rehearsal of Tree Lighting or Christmastime Ball, and sometimes even after the first week or two of shows!</p>
                    <p>There is no "vocal captain" responsible for keeping us at a high standard when we sing Goode Time material. In the end, WE are in charge of us, vocally. This means any one of us may need to speak up if we hear that something is off or clearly needs improvement.</p>
                    <p>Now, this can get tricky quickly. Most professional performers believe that we shouldn't give each other notes. In almost every performing situation, there is a director or music director who gives the notes. But we're operating essentially without a director when we perform Goode Time material. So, sometimes it falls to us to say something when our performance needs improvement. Because we are all proud performers who have to work in close quarters all day long, I suggest being as respectful and sensitive as possible if you have a point to offer at any point in the process. Whenever possible, phrase your suggestion in a way that doesn't seem accusatory, attacking, or belittling:  "Nathan, I don't think you're hitting the right pitch in that bar." vs. "Hey, can we sing through these two bars? Something sounds off there," for instance. And like any good performer receiving a note, try to understand and take the suggestion if it applies to you and resist the urge to complain or defend yourself. I'm absolutely guilty of this!</p>
                    <h4 class="special-note">This merits an important side-bar about checking your pride at the door and remembering the bigger picture. This gig MUST be approached in the spirit of teamwork. Our goal is not to pad our resume or impress higher ups at Disney with a stellar individual HKDL performance. Our goal is to embody and spread Christmas spirit, as envisioned by Disney. We are not the stars, even though we may feel like it at times. Mickey and Minnie are the stars. The giant Christmas tree is the star. The atmosphere we help to create that enables guests to escape reality for a few hours is the star. <strong>Not us</strong>. Always, always, always keep that in the back of your mind. Humility with this gig goes a LONG, LONG way. If you're the kind of performer who NEEDS an extra spotlight, this gig will disappoint you. Disney really values the experience (the 'magic') above all else. In that same vein, everyone at HKDL is working so hard and dealing with so much more than we see (and often being paid less than we are). They all deserve our respect and patience, even when we sometimes think they don't know how to do their job well (Again, totally guilty of this.) Stay grateful and humble and remember the bigger picture all the time!</h4>
                    <h4>Dividing Duties</h4>
                    <p>Different quartets handle our unique performance duties differently. My first year, our bass took charge of almost all the ancillary duties: set selection, blowing the correct starting pitch, & intros/outros, only occasionally soliciting opinions from the rest of the quartet. We all went with it, and it worked very well.</p>
                    <p>Other groups usually split the duties a little more cooperatively. One male usually handles setting the pitch for all the songs. One person (possibly the same person) generally does the intro after the first song of the set. (Sets often start with cold openers.) Sometimes that person intros all the songs, and sometimes other members will take on the intro duty for the next song(s). Often there's no intro into the next song. Maybe your quartet comes up with an intro "bit" that involves multiple people or a guest. You get the idea.</p>
                    <p>Regarding set selection, I think it works well to have one person, or the group, set a few "template" set lists of 5-8 songs each that you can rotate through regularly so that you don't end up singing the same songs every day. Then, changes can be made as necessary prior to a given set if people want to sing something different. And often, changes have to occur on the fly! (Your lead just told you your set has been cut from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. So much for set planning!)</p>
                    <p>Or, you can decide on a set list five minutes before every set by everyone shouting out the first song that pops into their head! (I seriously don't recommend that.) The point is, it's up to you and your quartet to decide how to handle that part of the job.</p>
                    <h4>Set List Ideas</h4>
                    <p>I personally love the art of crafting a great acappella set. Your choices can dramatically shape the audience experience, so I think it's worth making a few suggestions here.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Great openers are often shorter, uptempo, group-oriented (as opposed to solo-oriented), and start and finish with strong moments. I also like to use songs that aren't as well known in this slot since the very fact that you're singing will capture their focus. (e.g. O What a Merry Christmas Day, Hi to You, Here We Come A'Caroling, Caroling Caroling)</li>
                        <li>Intro time! Say something like, "Hello everyone, and Merry Christmas! We are the Disneyland Main Street Carolers. We are here today because we want to share Christmas music with all of you! Do you want to hear Christmas music today? Fantastic! Our next song will be ..." </li>
                        <li>You got their attention with the opener! Now change gears (without dropping the energy) and show them your musical restraint and control. This slot is often where I like to put one of our classic traditional or religious carols. (e.g. Angels We Have Heard On High, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, God Rest Ye, Good King Wenceslas)</li>
                        <li>Third song: if you went slower on the second song, bring the tempo back up with this one. If the second song was still relatively uptempo, dial the tempo back here. Maybe this song is more recognizable or includes a fun solo to focus their attention on a new aspect of the performance. (Practically anything can go here, depending on the situation. e.g. Frosty, Rudolph, Holly Jolly, Hippopotamus, All I Want for Christmas, Sleigh Ride, Most Wonderful Time, I Saw Mommy Kissing, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Depending on how long the set is, you get a lot more flexibility to mix in solo numbers, sillier songs, traditional songs, etc., always seeking to create an ebb and flow to the energy of the set and hence the audience. Filler songs, if you will. (e.g. Happy Holiday, Toyland, Here Comes Santa Claus, Let It Snow, O Tannenbaum, Carol of the Drum, Midnight Clear, Silver Bells, Up on the Housetop, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Not every song needs an intro. Intros definitely give everyone an opportunity to breathe between songs, but they can also disrupt the momentum of a set if they happen before every song. After the first intro, probably a rule of thumb is to do an intro every other song or so. Sometimes you have a good intro for a specific song, so you'll want to intro that one regardless of where it falls in the set. Use your judgment. In a short set, maybe you only intro the opener and the closer. It will depend on your set's circumstances.</li>
                        <li>Penultimate song of the set: Ideally a powerhouse number or an energy-builder to the final song of the set. Either a fantastic arrangement or fun solo, or it's just unabashedly joyful. (e.g. Carol of the Bells, Joy to the World, Rudolph, I'll Be Home, White Christmas) </li>
                        <li>Closing song intro: Usually lets the audience know this is your last song and that you've loved sharing Christmas cheer with them and that you hope they have an amazing rest of their day at Hong Kong Disneyland. If appropriate, you can also let them know that the carolers will be doing a short meet and greet for photos immediately after the last song.</li>
                        <li>Closers are often short and/or familiar and uptempo. Should definitely have a strong final moment to end the set strong. (e.g. Winter Wonderland, Jingle Bells, We Wish You a Merry Christmas, Jingle Bell Rock, Merry Christmas Round)</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <h4>Photo Moment</h4> 
                    <p>Guests at HKDL love meet-and-greets! If we do those this year, we will invite them to form a queue at the end of our set. Then we pose for photos with them until it is time for us to leave.</p>
                    <p>Be ready for people who do not respect the queue and try to get their photo in before someone who is waiting patiently in line. Try not to be too annoyed by it, even though it is monumentally obnoxious behavior. We have to remain cheerful, no matter what happens. Improv your way around awkward situations. Disney notoriously values preserving the magic at all costs. (Cue the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juFEwdN_de8">Shellie May literally passing out</a> from heat exhaustion during a parade but not being allowed to take off her character head.)</p>
            <h3>Modifications to Goode Time carols</h3>
                <h4>We will sometimes cut/alter some of the Goode Time carols for the sake of a better performance in the HK Disney environment.</h4> 
                <p>Below are some of the songs we have historically modified. I'll include a brief explanation of the change(s), but of course, you'll have to ensure you have learned the modifications, rehearsed them, and are comfortably ready to perform them, if your quartet has chosen to do so.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All I Want for Xmas -- No whistling 'fail' moment. Just let the bass lead into the next verse.</li>
                    <li>Grandma Got Run Over -- We haven't actually sung this one at HKDL since 2016, but if we ever do (which we almost certainly won't), we don't do the rap, cutting straight to the next section.</li>
                    <li>Happy Birthday -- Sometimes we cut the opening oohs. Generally we keep it fast too.</li>
                    <li>Here Comes Santa Claus -- For this one we change the ending to one that's less abrupt. Definitely consult with a vet. Maybe we can include audio files to demonstrate the change at some point.</li>
                    <li>Holly Jolly Christmas -- Tempo changes that are more easily taught/rehearsed in person than explained here.</li>
                    <li>Here We Come A’Caroling -- change the line to “but we are Disney carolers whom you have seen before”</li>
                    <li>I Saw Mommy Kissing -- We don't do the spoken interlude. We skip straight to the coda after "Oh what a laugh it would have been if Daddy had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus last--"</li>
                    <li>Jingle Bells -- One verse almost always</li>    
                    <li>Jingle Bell Rock -- Tempo changes, some added syncopation, and inserted snaps/claps. Like Holly Jolly, easier rehearsed than explained.</li>
                    <li>Joy to the World -- Every now and then we get the opportunity to do the second verse as a beatbox'd remix.</li>
                    <li>Most Wonderful Time -- "It's the hap (clap, clap), happiest season of all."</li>
                    <li>Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree -- The bass generally tones down the Elvis stylings, and we alter the ending slightly. Instead of the final jazzy "Oooh," we just pulse then hold the final word "tree" so that it kinda sounds like: "yeah we're rockin' round the Christmas tree-ee!"</li>
                    <li>Rudolph -- We change the ending to make it a little more tradtional-sounding and less of a jazzy, chromatic downward death spiral. It starts on the final "you'll go down in history." Easier to teach/rehearse than it is to explain. Will try to create/upload some audio of it.</li>
                    <li>Santa Baby -- We used to sing this as "Santa Goofy" while Santa Goofy would show up and perform with us. As a result, we sometimes will still perform this song subbing in 'Santa Goofy' for 'Santa Baby.' It's not as creepy as you might think! 😂</li>
                    <li>Santa Claus is Coming to Town -- Same idea here. You can totally do this song as "Santa Goofy's Coming to Town."</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="special-note">Vets, let me know if you can think of any other songs we alter.</p>
        <h2 id="costume-HMU">Costume/Makeup/Hair Considerations</h2>
                <h3>Costumes</h3>
                    <p>Every last costume item is provided by Disney. You will not have to bring any costume items of your own.</p>
                <h4>Prop note: Pitchpipes</h4>
                    <p>If you own a pitchpipe (or two), pack them. Goode Time (and Disney) traditionally expect one of the boys to handle pitchpipe duties during performance. Ideally, each group has at least two pitchpipes available, in case one goes missing, is left in a costume pocket accidentally, etc.</p>
                <h3>Makeup/Hair</h3>
                    <p>Everyone will, at some point, have to do a makeup and hair consultation. Historically, the consultant looks at the men and says, "You don't need to do anything except put a little product in your hair" before turning attention to the women.</p>
                    <p>The returning ladies can shed more light on the hair and makeup situation. I know mostly that it requires significant time investment each day and that you will all become great friends with the hair team.</p>

            <h3>Other attractions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Central - As the name implies, this district is 'central' to just about everything that happens in HK. Central is located on the southern side of Victoria Harbour, across from TST. It contains a transportation hub, government buildings, banks, restaurants/bars, cultural hotspots, street markets, trendy shopping, fancy hotels...basically one of HK's two "downtowns," with TST being the other.</li>
                    <li>Tsim Sha Tsui, aka TST - loads of fun to be had in TST. Plus, our hotel offers a cheap, frequent shuttle that takes you directly to/from the district.</li>
                    <li>Wan Chai/Causeway Bay - Wan Chai has some 'edgier' bars and restaurants, and Causeway Bay is a shopping/food epicenter. It even has its own "Times Square."</li>
                    <li>Ocean Park - the other theme park in Hong Kong: part amusement park, part zoo, and part aquarium!</li>
                    <li>Stanley - a neighborhood in the extreme southeastern part of HK that has great ocean views, promenades, shopping, restaurants, and a prison museum</li>
                    <li>Lamma Island</li>
                    <li>Cheung Chau Island</li>
                    <li>Tai O fishing village</li>
                    <li>Sai Kung - a beautiful region in the extreme northeast part of HK featuring beaches, epic hikes, and a lively port neighborhood</li>
                    <li>Day trip to Macau - This one may not be an option this year, as it involves leaving HK. 😭 But is is the Vegas of the East. Walk a casino floor, have a Portuguese egg tart (or seven), and see The House of Dancing Water, one of the most amazing shows you'll ever see.</li>
                </ul>  
            <h3>HK is one giant mall after another.</h3>

                    <li>ALL OF CAUSEWAY BAY</li>
                    <li>Flower Market/Bird Market</li>
                    <li>Basically every metro station is connected to a mall because the malls and the public transportation are owned by the same entity, or so I have heard.</li>
                    <li>T-Town, close to our hotel</li>
                    <li>Fortune Kingswood, <em>literally</em> connected to our hotel</li>

            <h3>Restaurants</h3>
                <h4 class="special-note">At the time I'm writing this, restaurants are largely shut down, but hopefully they'll be open enough for us to enjoy a few by the time we are there.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baba's Station: incredible Indian food in the smallest restaurant you've ever seen</li>
                    <li>Beef and Liberty - excellent burgers</li>
                    <li>Tim Ho Wan - cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world, great roast pork buns</li>
                    <li>Dim Dim Sum - another favorite dim sum spot</li>

                    <li>Ichiran - insanely delicious ramen</li>
                    <li>MANY others</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Night Life</h3>
                <h4 class="special-note">At the time I'm writing this, gatherings in HK are severely restricted, so it's not clear how much "night life" will be available to experience by the time we are there.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ned Kelly's Last Stand - the bandleader is one of our best friends in HK</li>
                    <li>Old Man - one of the best bars in the world</li>
                    <li>Ozone - the highest bar in the city, in the ICC building</li>
                    <li>Petticoat Lane - did someone say free vodka?</li>
                    <li>Lan Kwai Fong - the party district of HK</li>
                    <li>Miraplace in TST - cool strip of restaurants and live music clubs</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>Hiking in Hong Kong is one of the most rewarding activities you can do! Fresh air, exercise, exotic plants, occasional monkeys, and the views...oh man, the views.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dragon's Back</li>
                    <li>Lantau Peak</li>
                    <li>Victoria Peak</li>
                    <li>Lion Rock</li>
                    <li>Tai Tong - Sweet Gum Woods</li>
                    <li>Sunset Peak</li>
                    <li>Pineapple Dam Nature Trail - An easy one! With monkeys!</li>
                    <li>So many more. HK is simply an incredible city for hiking.</li>

        <h2 id="packing">Packing! What to bring/leave at home?</h2>
            
        <h3>Some non-obvious items you may want to consider packing</h3>
                <h4>Many of these items you can also purchase in HK, but consider packing your own if you'd rather have the item from the start of the contract and don't mind the extra weight in your luggage.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Kitchen towels/dish drying mat (none are provided)</li>
                <li>Preferred soap/dish soap, if you have one. A single, tiny bathroom bar soap is all that is provided by the hotel, and only at the beginning of your stay. All other soap you have to provide.</li>
                <li>Preferred pain/cold meds</li>
                <li>Voice remedies like Singer’s Saving Grace, etc.</li>
                <li>Along the same lines, if you like to steam your vocal passages, consider bringing your own small steamer, but be aware of any electrical concerns (see <a href="#electric">Electrical Concerns</a>)</li>
                <li>Dried spices/herbs, if you cook a lot</li>
                <li>Non-electric coffee-maker option, like a french press or a pourover, for those who need coffee from the get-go. The hotel provides an electric water kettle but not a coffee maker. (You can also purchase cheap, single-cup/multi-cup coffee makers in HK, if you are willing to wait until quarantine is done.)</li>
                <li>Lightweight bowl(s)/mixing bowl (The ones the hotel provides are pretty small.)</li>
                <li>Can opener</li>
                <li>Wine opener</li>
                <li>Coin purse/pouch (Coins are useful and accumulate quickly in HK)</li>
                <li>Laundry detergent pods, if you have a strong preference in detergent</li>
                <li>Preferred vitamins/supplements/protein powder</li>
                <li>Paper copy of your Passport/Birth Certificate/SS Card/Driver’s License. In the unfortunate event you lose your passport, copies of these items can help speed up your process of getting a replacement at an embassy/consulate.</li>
                <li>Extra passport photos and US cash. Originally these were useful for traveling in the area either during or after the contract, but that is probably not an option this year. That said, extra photos (and a copy of your ID docs, see previous item) could be helpful if you lose your passport. And US cash is still a very valuable commodity. Always have some extra US cash for an emergency.</li>
                <li>HDMI cable for connecting laptop to TV to watch Netflix etc.</li>
                <li>Not just good but GREAT walking shoes. You will walk all over the place.</li>
                <li>Compact grocery bags or totes (plastic bags cost extra at most grocery stores)</li>
                <li>Small tupperware (for packing meals/leftovers)</li>
                <li>Extra stick deodorant, if that is your preferred style of deodorant. It is hard to find in HK, for whatever reason.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Some items you should probably leave at home</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromecasts/Apple TV/Amazon Fire Sticks/Roku/Etc. (They can’t connect over our foreign- & hotel-based WiFi)</li>
                <li>Playstation, XBox, or other large electronic items (power and compatibility issues, even with a converter)</li>
                <li>Heavy winter wear. It will be in the 60s-80s during October/November and will be 50s-70s in December. Leave the snow parka at home. But bring layers, a warm scarf, gloves, and a compact fleece or light coat for those late December nights when it can still get pretty chilly.</li>
                <li>Mass quantities of dress clothes/shoes. Unless you plan to hit the clubs in Lan Kwai Fong on the regular or just love wearing nice things, you likely won’t have much occasion to wear nice clothes. 98% of the time, we wear comfy, casual clothes--or our costumes. (DO BRING at least one 'business-casual,' outfit you can wear on the very few occasions when Disney Look is required. Basically anything that's not jeans or flip-flops.) All this said, if Morgan comes up with another 'Ho Lang, Bitch' to perform at Petticoat Lane, FIERCE LEWKS will be encouraged 💃🕺. So, bring a couple of nicer outfits, but that’s likely all you’ll need.</li>
                <li>We have managed to see some Halloween costumes broken out in previous years. Like everything this year, I'm sure Halloween will look different, but if you have a creative costume idea that you can pack, you may well get the opportunity to show it off. 🎃</li>
            </ul>
                <h3 id="electric">Electrical concerns -- Adapters vs. Converters: what do you need?</h3>
                    <h4 class="special-note">What follows is a bit of a crash course in electrics. It is admittedly a confusing subject. The tl;dr version is: Save yourself heartache by buying cheap HK versions of any appliances you might be thinking of bringing. If you must bring your American appliance, you risk frying it if is not dual-voltage or if it is not plugged into a capable electric converter. Beyond that, you almost certainly want an adapter (or two) with USB ports, but know that adapters and converters are not the same thing, though you can buy adapter/converter combos.</h4>
                    <p>HK electrical outlets deliver 220V of electrical current and require plugs with the UK-style three-prong design.</p>
                    <img id="outlet-plug" src="Assets/UK-outlet-plug.jpg" alt="A picture of HK/UK-standard electrical outlets and plugs">
                    <p class="img-caption">This is the style of electrical outlet and plug you will find in HK.</p>
                    <p>Via use of a travel adapter, you can plug American electric devices into these sockets. BUT unless the device is dual-voltage (meaning it can handle 220V) you run the risk of overloading it with more voltage than the device can handle, potentially frying your item, rendering it trash. This is because American single-voltage devices are only built to handle the American standard of 110V.</p>
                    <!--<p>How do you determine whether a device is single- or dual-voltage? You have to look for the electric specs somewhere on the device. Here is what the specs look like on my Magic Bullet blender:</p>
                    <img id="blender" src="" alt="Picture of Magic Bullet Blender">-->
                    <p>You will likely need at least one travel adapter, and adapters are easily purchased in many places that sell electronics. An adapter:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>adapts your plug so that it will physically fit into a different style socket.</li>
                            <li>does NOT alter voltage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Therefore, simply using an adapter will not protect your American device from potentially roasting when it is plugged into the higher voltage Hong Kong electical outlet.</p>
                    <p>A voltage converter, on the other hand:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>changes voltage from 220V to the American standard of 110V, thereby protecting your devices, if the device is within the converter's power rating (measured in W, meaning 'watts')</li>
                            <li>are usually heavier, bulkier, and more expensive than adapters.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>If finding an acceptable converter sounds like a pain in the butt, you're not wrong. I found one in Hong Kong my first year. I used it for multiple contracts, but really I was only using it to convert voltage for my American-made Magic Bullet blender. Turned out I didn't need the converter for my laptop or phone charger, both of which were dual-voltage and needed only an adapter. Because I used my blender very little last year, I eventually gave away my voltage converter so that I wouldn't have to keep lugging around the extra ten pounds each contract. Sure, the converter did the job, but it was ten pounds!</p>
                    <p>Appliances are plentiful in HK, and they are easy for us to dispose of when the contract is done. (See #Dozo.) There is a glorious store called Mini So (which probably requires its own section of this webpage) where I plan to purchase a cheap personal blender this year. Single-cup coffee maker, alarm clock, personal scale, bluetooth speakers, all manner of small appliances--already calibrated for HK voltage--they can all be found in HK fairly easily.</p>
                    <p>So, after going down the converter route for multiple contracts, I have decided to go adapter-only this year.</p>
                    <p>That said, here are some Amazon links to converter/adapter combos that some vets have suggested:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/2000W-Travel-Adapter-Converter-Combo/dp/B088WQ1VNB/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=power%20converter%20doace&qid=1595986488&sr=8-7&fbclid=IwAR0ZJX9JWxrIURPxjJPNpyOaNBsYUx3m7s8ByDEBqeCfeX97hUys6NUQXlg" target=_blank>This one</a> should handle single-voltage electric items with a power rating of 26-2000W. That covers a lot of hair dryers, but according to its safety information, it "CAN NOT work with electronic controlled devices that are controlled by digital chips Which has auto shut-off, timer, temperature control, pulse, touch screen function such as Hair Straightener, Flat Iron, Curling iron, CPAP machine, Drill Battery, Coffee Machine, Blender, Heating Pad and so on. ###Converter Mode Can Not be used with low-wattage appliances (0-25W). Such as Hair Clipper, Electric Shaver, Electric Toothbrush and Dental Flossing Machine." </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-Universal-Converter-Charging-Worldwide/dp/B01E140XWA/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=power%20converter&qid=1595986712&sr=8-5&fbclid=IwAR3Kh-AUpSHL3jrm8FJxZzEvK_x1p6yhDlcsDO-IF2dTGRVSfxVrBlr8orc" target=_blank>Here is another</a> that has USB ports, but it specifically states that it is not compatible with hair dryers or any other device that is above 200W. That rules out a lot of medium-to-heavy-duty devices.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DQTL87X/ref=cm_sw_r_fm_api_i_x0niFb2EJV4XT?fbclid=IwAR1WW9BvGCjO1uFaeid6cQ2i_8j8XBxUHeVBujGBlFV9aLo45Tp3-Ka6QxI&th=1" target=_blank>One more with USB ports</a> with mostly positive reviews, but several point out that heavy duty hair dryers blew out the fuse.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="special-note">Deciding whether you need an electrical converter or merely a travel adapter depends on what devices you intend to bring with you from the US. If they can handle 220V, then an adapter is all you need. If they can't handle 220V, you'd have to use a converter that can accommodate your device. This means the converter's power rating (26W-2000W, for instance) includes that of your device (For instance, my Magic Bullet blender generates 150W, meaning it would work with a converter with a power rating of 26W-2000W.) You have to check your device's electrical label to know how many W it generates.</p>
